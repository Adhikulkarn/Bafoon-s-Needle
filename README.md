About Buffon's Needle Experiment
Buffon's Needle is a famous probability experiment proposed by the French mathematician Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, in the 18th century. The experiment involves dropping a needle onto a floor made of parallel lines spaced equally apart and calculating the probability of the needle crossing a line. Buffon showed that this probability could be used to estimate the value of π (pi), making this experiment one of the earliest Monte Carlo methods.

The formula Buffon derived to calculate π is: 
𝜋
≈
2
𝐿
×
𝑁
𝑡
×
𝐶
π≈ 
t×C
2L×N
​
  Where:

𝐿
L is the length of the needle.
𝑡
t is the distance between the parallel lines.
𝑁
N is the number of needles dropped.
𝐶
C is the number of times the needle crosses a line.
This website simulates the experiment visually and provides a hands-on learning experience for exploring this mathematical concept.

Website Structure and Code Overview
This website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for an interactive and visually engaging experience. Here's an overview of the files and their functionality:

1. indexneedle.html
The main webpage that displays the Buffon’s Needle simulation.
Includes interactive elements to control the simulation (e.g., throwing needles, resetting the visualization, adjusting the number of boards, etc.).
Uses D3.js to render the simulation and manage the visual representation of needles crossing the lines.
Provides controls for users to set parameters like needle size and zoom level.
Displays the ongoing estimation of π as the simulation progresses​
.
2. buffonsneedle.css
Styles the webpage with a minimalistic, clean look for easy readability.
Defines styles for buttons, sliders, and other UI elements.
Styles the graph and simulation area, ensuring needles are properly colored to indicate whether they cross a line or not.
Provides hover effects for better interactivity and aesthetics​
.
3. addneedle.js
Handles the logic for adding and simulating needles being thrown.
Provides a function addNeedles(numNeedles) that adds the specified number of needles to the visualization.
Uses console.log for debugging purposes to log the number of needles thrown​
.
4. style.css
Contains general styling for another part of the website (possibly a homepage or a related page).
Defines animations for different "flame" effects and button clicks for added interactivity​
.
5. index.html
Contains some button-based interactions for a potential homepage or secondary page.
Includes JavaScript to toggle effects when buttons are clicked, creating a dynamic and engaging experience​
